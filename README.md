# Hotelproject



This is the Hotel Project coded mainly in solidity.
Just a smart contract that allows people to book a hotel room and automatically gain ownership to it. 
When a room is booked it can't be rebooked but the one who booked it can have the ability to extend the book time. 
One can also transfer room ownership to someone else. 
The rooms are also categorized and as such each range if rooms have their prices. 
It is made in a way that your period after which the room becomes available for booking is just 30 minutes. 
For development purposes only. 
Hope you like it. 
Criticisms are welcomed.
